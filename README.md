The project uses https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html dataset for creating two conversational agents.

1. Run train.py for 30 epochs to train using Seq2seq model.
2. Run RL/train.py for 470 epochs to enhance the model using Reinforcement Learning.
3. Run RL/test.py to generate sample_output_RL.txt.
4. Run simulate.py to create dialog.txt where two conversational agents A and B converse with each other.
